Columbia University Project on Heat Engines

The goal of this project was:

1. To visualize the work (energy) output of a Gas Turbine cyle according to different compression ratio (R)

2. To visualize the Thermal Efficiency of the cycle for different value of R

3. Compute the optimal ratio R both for work output and thermal efficiency

4. Compare theoretical outputs and observed outputs for the cycle for different R

5. To visualize the relation between work output and thermal efficiency for different temperature
