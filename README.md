Columbia University Project on Heat Engines

The goal of this project was:
1. To visualize the work (energy) output of a Heat Engine according to different compression ratio (R) during the cycle
2. Compute the Thermal Efficiency of the cycle for different value of R
3. Compare theoretical outputs and observed outputs
